## Simple Tetris Game using Phaser

## WIP !
### What you need :

- A computer
- Node
- Probably a hand to type commands and/or play the game
- A brain, please, don't forget your brain

### How to run :

Install dependencies using this command (in the directory) :

```
npm install
```

run server using :

```
node index.js
```

It should run a server on localhost:3090 \*, use your web browser to go there
(I suppose you have one since you're reading this), enjoy .

\* (unless you changed it, But I guess you don't need these instructions then)
